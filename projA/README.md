# Project 6: Final Project Gear Up

The project handout can be found [here](https://cs1230.graphics/projects/final/gear-up/).

### Introduction
My scene features a starfield set against a slowly drifting red nebula, showcasing three core features: a Post-Processing Pipeline, Screen Space Bloom, and Scrolling Textures that animate the nebula independently of the stars. Both bloom strength and nebula scroll speed are adjustable via the live controls. The following shows the final effect:
